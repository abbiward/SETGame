<h1>Play SET in your browser</h1>

This is a JavaScript implementation of SET for solitary play. 

<h1>How you can play</h1>

Go to : <a>http://abbiward.github.io/SETGame/</a>

Alternatively, download the directory and open index.html.

Instructions:
Click on the cards you think will make a SET. They should be highlighted with a
dark border when selected. When you click 3 cards, the page will display text 
below the card area. If the three
cards make a set, then it says "Set!". If they're not, it says "Not a set :("

To deselect a card, select it again.

The page will also display "THERE IS NO SET" when there's no SET available among the displayed cards. 
It also keeps track of the number of sets you've found. 

Press the reset button to reset the game.

Also, cardgenerator.py is a python script which uses PyGame to generate the card images. Using it, you can change how the cards look (colors, shapes etc.).
